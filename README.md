# Improper Error Handling in Express.js Database Query

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: inadequate error handling during database interactions.  The provided `bug.js` file showcases an Express.js route that fetches user data from a database. However, it fails to handle potential errors gracefully, logging them only to the console instead of providing informative error responses to the client.  The solution, found in `bugSolution.js`, implements proper error handling to return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages to the client.
